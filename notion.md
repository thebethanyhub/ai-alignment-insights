ðŸª© My Notion Workspace on AI & Emotional Systems ðŸª©


ðŸ‘‰ This file links to my public [Notion](https://www.notion.so/Welcome-218d0eafdd7480b39da4d4d4c21df9e5?source=copy_link), which includes examples of my work with AI, emergent alignment, trauma-informed frameworks, and dissertation notes.


It serves as a living portfolio documenting iterative experiments, emotional prompting templates, and deeper explorations of how AI can evolve beyond code into systems that understand.
